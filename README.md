My name is Joseph Roth! I made this repository because I wanted a website, but a website is too complicated to maintain. Instead, I use this repository to document the various journeys that I am on right now. There are two main journeys that I am on: Building my dream video game and making the perfect Carne Asada burrito.

The video game that I intend to build has existed in my mind in some form or other since I was in college, around 2011 or so. My obsessions include sci-fi, grand strategy, physics simulation, sandbox worlds, mmos, big data, emergent behaviors, logistics, history, and humanities. I do not really desire to create a video game – I desire to create a world from which a video game can arise. As I attempt to assemble this game which has haunted me for so many years, I intend to write down my progress and hopefully what I write will make someone’s life better.

The perfect Carne Asada burrito came from a small burrito shack which my brother-in-law introduced me to. It was made by a man named Orlando - the owner of that burrito shack. I have a taste-memory of them which I do not have the culinary skill to put into words. Unfortunately, Orlando’s burrito shack closed, and so I have to cook my own burritos. Luckily, I like cooking, and I like experimenting. I hope to write down a few of my experiments and help other amateur chefs on their own journeys. Note that my experiments are not limited to Carne Asada.

Given the state of politics in the United States of America in 2025, I have very strong political opinions, and will likely share some of those in a politics blog as well.
I am very strongly liberal. I define a Liberal to be someone who "Holds these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, and that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." 

Other notes about me:

    1. I am a credentialed actuary! As of 2025, I hold an Associate of the Society of Actuaries credential, and have almost six years of experience in pension and life actuarial work.
    2. The name Kingdok comes from Jeff Smith’s wonderful comic book series, Bone. From my childhood I have had a deep love for that series, and Kingdok has been my most frequent online name. I have never asked Jeff Smith about using one of his characters’ names, and I hope that he appreciates that I chose the name because what he created mattered to me.
    3. Ragnarok just rhymes with Kingdok and I did go through a brief Norse Mythology obsession as a kid.
    4. I am married with three kids.
    5. Combining notes 2 and 4, my oldest daughter (age 7 as of 2025) has read Bone. Three or four times! She was Bartleby for Halloween.
