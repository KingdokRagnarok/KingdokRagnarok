This time, I am doing my write up over two weeks after the experiment. Next time I should write up the Objectives and Target Recipe ahead of time. This time I made carnitas, and attempted to improve my side dishes. I definitely improved the sides by putting a little more care into them.
Overall Objectives

My overall objectives remain the same - restated here:

I want a beef entree that replicates the taste and texture of Orlando’s Carne Asada.

The marinade should match taste.

The cut of beef should match texture.

The beef preparation should match texture.

I want a collection of sides, that, together with the Carne Asada, replicates the taste and texture of Orlando’s Carne Asada Burrito.

I want a burrito preparation technique that permits me to replicate the construction of an Orlando’s Carne Asada Burrito.

As a secondary objective, I would like to explore substitute preparation methods.

Today’s Objective

In this experiment, I am focusing on item 2 - I want to develop my repertoire of burrito sides. My side list is:

Beans

Rice

Salsa

Olives

Cheese

Target Recipe

The base target recipe was https://www.recipetineats.com/pork-carnitas-mexican-slow-cooker-pulled-pork/

I had a ~8 lb pork roast - twice the size used in the recipe, so I doubled the other ingredients

I used an oven, following the instructions in note 2.

Ingredients:

Skipping over the ingredients for now because (1) It's in the linked recipe, and (2) I'm writing up almost 3 weeks late.

Process

I made one big mistake here:

I chose to sear the outside of the roast in my dutch oven before I put it in the oven. However, I started searing before I put the dry rub on! So the dry rub was placed mostly on just one side of the roast - the side which hadn't been seared yet.


Sides Target Recipes

Beans

Base Recipe: https://fedbysab.com/chipotle-black-beans-copycat-recipe/

I used this recipe, but did not follow the proportions exactly.

I used 2 cans of beans, and I went low on chile power and cayenne pepper (have to be careful with spice levels for my kids). I may have also been low on Cumin - but I didn't meausre it anyways. 

I also did not use fresh lemon/lime juice.

Overall this was fine. I was a bit rushed and didn't confirm my spice supplies before I started working.

Rice

Base Recipe: https://littlespicejar.com/cilantro-lime-rice/

I followed this recipe almost exactly, only modifying

The water volume to match the proportions recommended by the rice I used.

I used bouillon paste instead of bouillon cubes.

The rice was excellent - proper texture, and lime juice and cilantro definitely infused well.

I suspect I should write this recipe up in its own post since it's finalized now.

Salsa

For this dinner, I used the same recipe as last time.

Original Recipe: ” 4 cups diced tomatoes (Roma works best, be sure to strain them for seeds and juice) 1 cup cilantro, chopped 1 cup red onion, diced 1/3 cup diced, seeded jalapeño 1 tbsp salt 1 tbsp crushed black pepper 1 tbsp lime juice – combine in a bowl and mix”

Unlike last time, I did not rinse the tomatoes. I just removed the seeds and chopped the main part of the tomatoes. I also put it only a tsp of salt and pepper at first, and then added more to taste. 

End result: Good Pico! Not too salty this time!

Next time, I'm going to see if I can somehow separate the tomato juice from the seeds and add the tomato juice to the Pico.

Olives

Safeway brand Jumbo black olives, cut in thirds. I was hoping to reduce time spent slicing olives, but these olive chunks were way too big.

Cheese

Monterrey Jack cheese. Finely grated. Delicious.

Tortilla

Mission white flour tortillas, medium size. Good. I guess. Still looking for huge burrito tortillas, but I don't care that much. Maybe I should warm them?

Results

The Carnitas were great, despite my cooking errors. The sides turned out very well.

Next Steps

I am confident that my sides are strong enough that I can return to Carne Asada. I need to find either some skirt steak (For proper Carne Asada), or some Chuck steak (ie diezmillo). I also need to completely write up my target recipe and assemble all the ingredients needed before even initiating my next attempt. Honestly it's insane that I ran low on Cumin in the middle of making tacos! Outrageously dumb.
