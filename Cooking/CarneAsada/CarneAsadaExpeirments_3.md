Carne Asada Experiments 3: Plan

This time, I remembered to type out my plan before I conducted the experiment. The next post will be the experiment itself, which I intend to conduct following the Eagles' annual trip to Tampa Bay to be thwacked by Baker Mayfield.
Overall Objectives

My overall objectives remain the same – restated here:

    I want a beef entree that replicates the taste and texture of Orlando’s Carne Asada.
        The marinade should match taste.
        The cut of beef should match texture.
        The beef preparation should match texture.
    I want a collection of sides, that, together with the Carne Asada, replicates the taste and texture of Orlando’s Carne Asada Burrito.
    I want a burrito preparation technique that permits me to replicate the construction of an Orlando’s Carne Asada Burrito.
    As a secondary objective, I would like to explore substitute preparation methods.

Today’s Objective

In this experiment, I am focusing on item 1. I am confident in my sides, and I want to go back to beef as the meat base to see if I can replicate Orlando's Carne Asada burritos.

Sides Target Recipes

    Beans
        In other experiments, my wife and I have concluded that beans are better to just do by taste.
        Rinse a can of low sodium black beans in a colander
        Put them in a pot with some water.
        Dump in some collection of spices (Mostly cumin, paprika/smoked paprika, salt)
        Get them to simmer for a while (~.5 hour), keeping water level low (Beans not necessarily fully covered)
        Adjust seasoning to taste, throw in some lime at the end.
    Rice (Credit https://littlespicejar.com/cilantro-lime-rice/)
        Rinse 1.5 Cups rice (Signature Select Enriched Long-Grain Rice) in sieve
        Melt 2 Tbsp butter in rice-cooking vessel
        Add rice and stir for 1.5 min
        Add Garlic and sauté 30 seconds
        Add 3 cups water (per 2-1 Water/rice ratio from rice cooking instructions)
        Add .5 tsp bouillon/chicken broth base
        Salt water
